Well made project, just note that the very last README.md instruction could be a bit misleading, since you would expect to have to provide all the arguments at the same time, while in reality the program can be executed without any arguments, and ask them one per time; aso something less, like simply `./PSO_EXEC`, it's enough. If you whish, you could add a set of typical parameters (number of particles...) and the expected result, to further facilitate testing.
